    A $(388.5 \pm 0.15)$m Coaxial Line of coaxial cable with inner radii and outer dielectric
    radii of $(0.55\pm 0.05)$mm and $(1.85 \pm 0.05)$mm the transmission velocity
    of a pulse was found at $v = (2.0133 \pm 0.02296) \times 10^8 \text{ms}^{-1}$. The dielectric constant
    of the insulator was found at $\epsilon_r = (2.2204 \pm 0.0506)$ and the attenuation coefficient was
    found at $\alpha = (5.425 \pm 0.1020) \times 10^4 \text{m}^{-1}$.
