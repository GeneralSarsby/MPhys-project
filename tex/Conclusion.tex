\section{Conclustion}
For the two sections of the experament, the key results are summarised below.
\begin{align*}\\
l &= (388.56 \pm 0.15) \text{m}\\
v &= (2.0133\pm 0.02296)\times 10^8 \text{ms}^{-1}\\
\epsilon_r &= 2.2204 \pm 0.0506\\
Z_0 &= (52.614\pm6.348)\Omega\\
\alpha &= (5.425 \pm 0.1020)\times 10 ^{-4} \text{m}^{-1}
\end{align*}

These values are relatively un-remarkable and, although not incredibly accurate,
do give insight to to how well coaxial cable is a transmitting a signal. Which
is, quite well indeed.

\subsection{Possible Furtherance}
The graph use to find $\alpha$ was only carried out at a constant value of $V_i$.
Varying $V_i$ over a small range of values would hopefully produce a more reliable 
graph to use and may even show some other interesting trends (curling at high voltages?)
