Hi this is Matt

This reposatory is for my masters project.
I'm used to working with LaTeX, but this is
the first time I've used Git.


Features of this template:
Makefile:
    make all (everything includeing references from bibtex etc.)
    make quick (just pdflatex once over report.tex)
    make clean (cleans all temp files)
Multi-file setup
    each section has a file found in ./tex/ and included into the main report.
    all the better to work with tabs!
Bibtex intergraion
    I've got a basics setup in References.bib
Graphing
    to create nice latex graphes there is a ./graphs/ python scrips that will do
    the work
    
ToDo
add git reposatory? DONE
add /index ? (there is a command for this somewhere) DONE
get indexhyperlinks to go to the correct page, currentally off by 1 to soon. but
it does go to the correct page numbered (at the bottom)
