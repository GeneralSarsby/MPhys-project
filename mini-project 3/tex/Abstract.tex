Using resonances generated by a coil heater and detected with a 
Allen-Bradley resistor and a phase detector, the presence of second sound was observed on an oscilloscope.
Inside a tube of length $72\pm1$mm, the resonances were used to measure the
velocity of second sound in superfluid \he-II at 1.46K, in a undergraduate lab, to be
$v = (19.8372 \pm 0.2761) \text{ms}^{-1}$. 
Also observed are the node--antinode structure 
of the resonance of second sound, and by varying temperature the 
drop in velocity to zero when temperature approaches the transition temperature.
